I started out in the 90s working in public schools—drilling through concrete, hanging wire molding, and punching down hundreds of connections in wiring closets. It wasn’t glamorous work, but it gave me a real understanding of how everything connects—physically and technically.

Back then, I was part of a JTPA program that let me work while attending college. I majored in network administration, learning about routers, switches, and how to keep things online when no one else knew what was wrong.

As the years went on, I moved from local installs and on-prem systems to bigger projects, and eventually the cloud. The shift wasn’t instant. It took time, study, and a few hard lessons. But I earned certifications like AWS Solutions Architect, AWS DevOps, and CompTIA Cloud+—and more importantly, I learned how to *actually apply* them.

Along the way, I picked up more than just technical skills:

- I learned to adapt when the tech stack changed overnight.
- I learned that continuous learning isn’t optional—it’s the job.
- I found that helping others (especially junior engineers) made me a better engineer too.
- And I learned that patience pays off. You can’t rush confidence, but you can earn it.

Now I work as a Technical Account Manager, using what I’ve learned in SIP, SBCs, AWS, and cloud design to help teams stay stable, secure, and scalable. I’ve supported public safety orgs, Fortune 100s, and environments that can’t afford downtime.

The tools change. The platforms change. But the mindset stays the same:  
**Keep learning. Stay grounded. Solve real problems.**

That’s been my journey so far. And I’m not done yet.
